<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>Our gorgeous planet is well worth exploring, but we only have one and need  to take
good care of it! The same goes for our body - it's an amazing machine, but it needs
to be cared for. Both of these important thoughts are covered in our eco-friendly
bicycle tours concept!</p>
<br>
<p>Biking is fun, and such a great way to get up close and personal with the city and your
surroundings. Breathing the fresh air while you descover the wonders of Trondheim - without
being held back by some glass, is really something worth trying. </p>
<br>
<p>We have a wide range of tours and guides, so we're sure to have something that fit's your
needs and wishes. Have a look and come ride with us!</p>

<div class="howto">
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Have a look at our tours to find out which ones you'd like to participate in. Our tours vary in
length and group-sizes. Some are early, others late - both to create the best atmosphere and fit your schedule.</p>
<br>
<p>Once you find the one you want, sign up through mail or phone. You'll get a reply with specific details for
where and when to show up. We also do drop-ins if there's room, but it might be good to ask ahead to be sure you'll
get a spot.</p>
<br>
<p>We have bikes for everyone, but you can choose to bring your own if you prefer. (Payment info here) Don't hesitate to ask if you have
any questions!</p>
